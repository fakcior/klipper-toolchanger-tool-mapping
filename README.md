# Klipper Toolchanger Tool Mapping

This repository provides a tool mapping for klipper-toolchanger.

**Note: This project is a work in progress. Features and configurations may change as development continues.**

**IMPORTANT!: Compatible with Moonraker v0.9.3-72 - Uses its metadata parsing implementation**

## Installation

1. Add tool_mapping.cfg to your config (should be included after Tool_x.cfgs, so it overrides their Tx definitions)
2. Add variables.cfg to your config
[OBSOLETE] 3. Add toolchanger_metadata.py to moonraker/components directory.
[OBSOLETE] 4. Add [toolchanger_metadata] section below [file_manager] in moonraker.conf
5. If installed previous release remove toolchanger_metadata.py from moonraker/components directory and [toolchanger_metadata] section in moonraker.conf.
6. Restart Klipper

## Configuration

Adjust tool_mapping.cfg and variables.cfg so it matches number of the tools in your machine.
Override default filament options in Mainsail Toolchanger Panel with filament_types_options in variables.cfg if needed.
Recommended to put SELECT_TOOL T=0 before homing in PRINT_START macro to ensure homing with tool 0 regardless of mapping.

## Usage

  SET_TOOL_MAPPING T=x TOOL=y â€“ Assigns command Tx to control physical tool y.
